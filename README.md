### Introduction
Millions of people commute by car every day; for example, to school or to their workplace.
Self-driving vehicles are an exciting development for transportation. They aim to make traveling by car safer and more available while also saving commuters time.
In this competition problem, weâ€™ll be looking at how a fleet of self-driving vehicles can efficiently get commuters to their destinations in a simulated city.
### Task
Given a list of pre-booked rides in a city and a fleet of self-driving vehicles, assign the rides to vehicles, so that riders get to their destinations on time.
For every ride that finishes on time (or early), you will earn points proportional to the distance of that ride; plus an additional bonus if the ride also started precisely on time.
